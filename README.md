A detailed profile page with information on the entrepreneur’s business, specializations, needs, and offerings.
Ability to update business information, such as new services or products.

Analytics dashboard to see user engagement and growth of the community.
Technical Stack:
Frontend:

React Native for cross-platform mobile app development (iOS and Android).

Database Integration:

Develop the database schema for users, posts, matches, and event data.
Matching Algorithm Development:

Develop and integrate the algorithm that pairs entrepreneurs based on “asks” and “haves.”
Testing:

Perform unit, integration, and system testing to ensure everything works seamlessly.
